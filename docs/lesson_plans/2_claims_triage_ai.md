# Lesson Plan: Claims Triage AI

## Objective
Develop an AI system to automatically classify and prioritize insurance claims using supervised machine learning techniques.

## Key Topics
- Text vectorization (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation metrics
- Data labeling and annotation strategies

## Skills Gained
- Feature engineering for textual data
- Supervised ML workflow from preprocessing to prediction
- Evaluation and interpretability of models
- Practical AI in insurance and risk triage

## Project Outcome
An intelligent pipeline that ingests claim descriptions and predicts routing priority and department.
