# Lesson Plan: Neurodegenerative Disease Detection

## Objective
Apply multimodal deep learning techniques to detect early signs of diseases like Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s from speech and facial data.

## Key Topics
- Multimodal ML (audio, video, text)
- Speech signal processing and feature extraction
- CNNs and RNNs for classification
- Model explainability in healthcare

## Skills Gained
- Integrating heterogeneous data sources
- Deep learning for sequence and image data
- Medical AI modeling considerations
- Ethics and validation in healthcare AI

## Project Outcome
An AI system that analyzes audio and facial inputs to classify the likelihood of neurodegenerative conditions.
